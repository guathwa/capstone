The Singapore government downgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2019 to be between 0.0% to 1.0% from 1.5% to 2.5% (source: Ministry of Trade and Industry). In view of the weaker outlook, businesses are likely to remain conservative with their capital investments and expansion plans, which will dampen demand for industrial space.

Against the above-mentioned backdrop, rental rates are expected to remain subdued.  Australia The Australian economy grew by a lower 1.4% y-o-y in 2Q 2019 compared to 1.8% y-o-y a quarter ago.

In October 2019, the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered the cash rate for the third time in 2019 from 1.0% to 0.75% to support employment and income growth and achieve its inflation target over time. Consensus GDP growth forecast for 2019 is 1.9% y-o-y (source: Bloomberg), lower than the 2.3% y-o-y growth in 2018.   s Australian properties continue to deliver a stable performance due to their good location, long weighted average lease to expiry of 4.3 years and average annual rent escalations of approximately 3% per annum.  United Kingdom (UK) In 2Q 2019, the UK economy rose by 1.3% y-o-y compared to 2.1% y-o-y in 1Q 2019. The services sector, which is the largest contributor to the UK economy, weakened to 0.1% q-o-q (1Q 2019: +0.4% q-o-q).
